                            <h3>How Challenges Faced by the Farmers In India </h3>
                            <p>
                                Farming is quite an unpredictable business. Farmers should meet the challenges such as soil erosion, inadequate rainfall climate changes, and more. The better productivity of the agricultural products also depends on the best quality of the agricultural goods sown in the soil. Modern Agricultural Technologyhas helped the Farmers to overcome some of the challenges in Agriculture but still many of the problems remain unresolved with the different landscapes and soil.

                                More demand for the Best Quality of Grains and Food Supply.

                                Climate Changes will also determine crop productivity.

                                The Global Economy also plays a Major Role in determining the pricing factors.

                                India is a Land of Agriculture. Not Many Farmers are making a good profit out of the Agricultural Business in India. The Unavailability of ModernEquipment and Poor irrigation also provide a setback to the Farmers In India to produce a good quality and better volume of agricultural crops. Many Farmers are unable to Invest in Storing their produced agricultural goods to sell them at better prices when the economy goes up.

                                Most Agricultural products are highly perishable goods thatmust be sold immediately, This provides a chance for the local
                                traders to procure/purchase the agricultural products at very less rates compared to the actual market rates. Most of the Farmers are very much at the Loss and are unable to make a minimum Return on Investment as they sell their products to
                                the local agents.

                                In India, We have seen that few of the farmers use to throw away the agricultural grown crops on the roadsides, The Reason for the same is because the agricultural products are not sold. The Absence of the right market for the farmers creates havoc that the farmers are not able to sell their grown agricultural products. The Agents or Middlemen are unable to provide reasonable rates for thegrown agricultural products. This situation has troubled many of the farmers to go in the losses and throw their unsold agricultural-grown products onthe roads.

                                Quickly depletingfresh water around the world along with soil depletion with very less rainfall and changing climatic conditions affects the farmers to always expect unpredicted agricultural produce. COVID-19 has made several food processing units shut down their operations. So, The Agricultural farmers are unable tosell their grown crops to the Food Processing Units. Hence, the dependence on the local traders has increased and the farmers are selling their grown agricultural products at a very less price and under margin.

                                Many of the Farmers in India wipe out and in serious debt. The highly unstable demand for agricultural products across the globe has worsened the situation of the farmers. Mobile Mandi is consistently working on providing the right technological platform for the farmers to sell their agricultural products at the best price which is profitable for the farmers.
