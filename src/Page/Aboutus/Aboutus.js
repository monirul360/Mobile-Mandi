                                    <h2>How is Mobile Mandi Unique?</h2>
                                    <p>Mobile Mandi Platform helps the Farmers/Agents to sell their agricultural products to buyers anywhere in India. Mobile Mandi Platform will check both the KYC of the Buyer and Seller to ensure the proper transactions. The Buyers can also leave a review on the Seller/Farmer/Agent once the product is purchased and the agricultural goods are arrived and verified by the buyer. </p>
                                    <p>Mobile Mandi keeps the records of every seller and buyer to ensure future audits. For several years our Farmers have struggled a lot with a very less profit as they have quite little knowledge of the market and selling of their grown crops in the market. Many of the Farmers have struggled with not even getting 10% of the Profits.</p>
                                    <p>India is the homeland of agriculture and India is the first largest country in the world producing Milk, Jute, and Pulses. We, India is also the second largest producer of Rice, Wheat, Groundnuts, Sugarcane, Fruits, and Vegetables along with Cotton. India is also one of the top countries producing Spices and Plantation Crops.</p>

                                    <h2>Challenges faced by Farmers In India</h2>
                                    <p>If a higher crop yield is required, the farmers must sow better and good quality seeds for better agricultural production.  Better Quality Seeds are high in price and only normal quality seeds are available to a few of the farmers. The depletion of the soil also results in lesser production compared to the earlier years. These and many more challenges make the farmers in India completely dwell in the agricultural problems and not able to involve themselves in the sales and marketing of their agricultural products. </p>
